# glassdoor-job-reviews
I use machine learning, specifically a basic neural network with LSTM and multi-head attention layers to predict glassdoor job review ratings. Additionally, I use GloVe embeddings, TF-IDF and LDA to preprocess and analyze the text data. 

Based on the real data, I achieved 15th out of 45 students in the prediction competition.

Please reach out via LinkedIn if you would like the training data.
